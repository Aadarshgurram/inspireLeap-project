Task 3

Apply supervised learning models like Linear Regression and Decision Tree on the Titanic dataset after performing data cleaning and feature engineering


Data Preprocessing: Use the cleaned and feature-engineered dataset.
Model Training: Train both a Linear Regression model and a Decision Tree model on the training data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate both models using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), RÂ² score for regression tasks, and accuracy for classification tasks.
