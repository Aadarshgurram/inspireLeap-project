Task 2

Data cleaning and feature engineering are essential steps in preparing a dataset for machine learning models. Using the Titanic dataset

Step-by-Step Guide for Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering on Titanic Dataset

Loading the Titanic Dataset: First, we need to load the dataset using pandas to explore the features and identify any missing or inconsistent data.

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing values.
Remove duplicates.
Correct inconsistent data types or formats.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features (e.g., extracting titles from names, creating age categories).
Convert categorical features into numerical representations.
Feature scaling or normalization.
